## __Welcome to Mars Photos!__

This Flask app takes the latest photos of Mars from [NASA's Open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) and displays them. I have used the Python requests module to make an API request. I have also used the Bootstrap framework to style my website. The API updates every few days, so check back soon for fresh images! Click below for explanaitons of each route.

This page displays the photos taken by NASA's rovers on Mars! Jinja templating is used to loop through the list of photos returned from the API request and display them in Bootstrap carousels. Images from Perseverance and Curiosity are displayed in separate carousels. The date the photos were taken on is also displayed.
